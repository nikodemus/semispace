 SemiSpace has a module which allows JavaScript to communicate to an
 {{{http://www.cometd.org/}cometd}}-enabled webserver. The javascript interface
 mimics the {{{../apidocs/org/semispace/SemiSpaceInterface.html}Java interface}}
 as closely as possible.

 Presently, cometd-1.x is used. This will later be migrated to cometd-2.x.
 Cometd has a page with {{{http://cometd.org/node/87}overview over the migration
 path of classes and packages}}. At a time where it is stable and sufficiently
 wide spread, websocket is going to be the main target.
