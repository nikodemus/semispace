Communication channel overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The communication between the comet client and java webapp
 comet server is asynchronous. The communication is initiated
 with a <call>, and returned with a <reply> (except in the
 case of notify, which is a special case).

 The communication channels are as follows:

*-------------------------------------+---------------+
|| Channel                  || purpose ||
*-------------------------------------+---------------
| /semispace/call/read/<number>  |  Initiate a read request. |
*-------------------------------------+---------------
| /semispace/reply/read/<number> | Reply of a read, with the payload being the result if it was obtained. |
*-------------------------------------+---------------
|/semispace/call/take/<number>    | Initiate a take request.|
*-------------------------------------+---------------
|/semispace/reply/take/<number>   | Result of take. |
*-------------------------------------+---------------
|/semispace/call/write/<number>   | Insert an object into the space. This is a <<synchronous>> operation when using the comet java client.|
*-------------------------------------+---------------
|/semispace/reply/write/<number>  | Acknowledge that the element has been written.|
*-------------------------------------+---------------
|/semispace/call/notify/<number>/<type>  | Register a notification.  This is a <<synchronous>> operation when using the comet java client.|
*-------------------------------------+---------------
|/semispace/reply/notify/<number>/<type> | Acknowledge that the notification has been registered. |
*-------------------------------------+---------------
|/semispace/event/notify/<number>/<type> | Attached is a notification event. |
*-------------------------------------+---------------
|/semispace/call/leasecancel/<number>  | Cancel lease with callId as mapped parameter |
*-------------------------------------+---------------
|/semispace/reply/leasecancel/<number>  | Acknowledge of listener cancellation |
*-------------------------------------+---------------

 Channel parameters are:

 [number] Channel number. When having, for example, two simultaneous read operations,
 this number must be different for the two operation. The easiest is to have a client
 side sequence number, which is just incremented for each call.

 [Notification type] The type is one of <<<availability>>>, <<<expiration>>>, <<<taken>>>, <<<renewal>>> and
 <<<all>>>. The Java client only uses <all>, and the proxy will translate this into the correct response
 object. This is as the Java client does not know in beforehand what kind of notification that is registered.

 []

 It does not matter if several different clients use the same channel numbers. The communication to
 the client is based on the client ID, and has nothing to do with the channel number.

Parameter overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The parameters sent over the channel are packed JSON style. Then the control elements
 are extracted. The following is an overview:

*--------------------------+--------------------+---+
|| Operation               || Parameter || Significance ||
*--------------------------+--------------------+---+
| read                     | duration  | How long to wait for an object if it is not in the space. |
|                          | json      | Payload to match. First level is object type, the second level are elements to match. (I.e. in a person object with firstname, lastname, it would be firstname=xxx). You cannot have 2 levels.|
*--------------------------+--------------------+---+
|  take                    |  ... | Same parameters as read |
*--------------------------+--------------------+---+
| write                    | timeToLiveMs | How long the object shall live in the space TODO Shall change to duration |
|                          | json | Payload. This is the String representation of the client side JSON object.
*--------------------------+--------------------+---+
|  notify                  | duration  | How long the notification registration shall exist. |
|                          | json | As for read |
*--------------------------+--------------------+---+
| lease cancel             | callId | The caller id the notification lease is registered to. |
*--------------------------+--------------------+---+
